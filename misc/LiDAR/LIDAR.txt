LIDAR Specifications
What is a LiDAR: Light Detection and Ranging
Pulse: Light emitted by LiDAR system
Return: Reflected light energy recorded by sensor
LiDAR Point Cloud: Component responsible for calculating time and distance.
** LiDAR has in-built GPS and IMU units (maybe we can use those with meta data or smthn)

Difference between OS1 Gen1 and OS1 Rev07:
1. Minimum Range ( 0.8 vs 0)
2. Vertical Resolution (64 vs 128)
3. FoV (16.6 vs 21.2 or 33.2 vs 42.4)
4. Data Per Point: Same

Ouster provides its own software for visualizing the Ouster LiDAR data but is not compatible with Ubuntu 2022 onwards. https://data.ouster.io/downloads/software-user-manual/Ouster-Studio-2.0.4.pdf
